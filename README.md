# Engineering Portfolio Workshop – Starter Template

This repository supports a hands-on workshop on building and publishing
a professional engineering portfolio.

You do NOT need prior experience with web development.

---

## What This Is

-   A simple, professional portfolio template
-   A blueprint that works across platforms:
    -   GitHub Pages
    -   Wix
    -   WordPress
    -   Google Sites

The goal is to help you **communicate your work clearly**, not to learn web development.

### `/template`

This contains the files you will edit during the workshop.

-   `index.html` – your portfolio content and structure
-   `style.css` – basic visual styling

You can download this folder as a ZIP and work locally.

During the workshop, you will:

1. Fill in your portfolio content using the template
2. Choose **one** way to publish it:
    - GitHub Pages (optional, technical)
    - Website builders (Wix / WordPress / Google Sites)

All options are valid for job applications.

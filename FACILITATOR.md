# Facilitator Guide – Engineering Portfolio Workshop

## Workshop Objective

Participants leave with:
- A structured, professional portfolio draft
- At least one clear publishing path
- Optional experience deploying a site via GitHub Pages

This is NOT a web development class.

---

## Key Messages to Reinforce

Say these explicitly:

- “HTML is a blueprint, not a requirement.”
- “Content clarity matters more than platform choice.”
- “All publishing paths shown today are acceptable.”

---

## What NOT to Teach

Do not explain:
- JavaScript
- Git internals
- Hosting infrastructure
- SEO or optimization
- CSS customization beyond basics

Redirect questions that go too deep.

## Common Participant Issues

**“I don’t understand HTML.”**
→ “You don’t need to. Treat it like a form.”

**“Can I just use Wix?”**
→ “Yes. The structure is the same.”

**“Why not React?”**
→ “Because that’s not the skill being taught.”

## Success Criteria

The workshop is successful if participants:
- Have written meaningful portfolio content
- Understand how sections map across platforms
- Feel confident publishing later
